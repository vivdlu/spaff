## Welcome to the SPAFF App

This is a web app intended for internal use within The Gottman Institute, LLC, and the <a href="https://www.gottman.com/love-lab/" target="_blank">Love Lab at The Gottman Institute</a>.

## About SPAFF

In 1989, the Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF) was developed by John Gottman, Ph.D., and Lowell J. Krokoff, Ph.D., for the purpose of systematically observing affective behavior in the context of marital conflict. The original SPAFF conferred a host of advantages over earlier “microanalytic” coding strategies, the primary innovation being the ability to code affect at the construct level instead of at the level of extremely discrete bits of behavior, such as specific gestures or facial movements (Gottman, McCoy, Coan, & Collier, 1995).

## Purpose

Today, researchers in the Love Lab at The Gottman Institute continue to use the Specific Affect Coding System to analyze the affective behavior of couples during observed conflict discussions. This app is intended to digitize the process (previously conducted on equipment housed in the lab) by providing an online interface for rating couples with more mobility, accuracy, and scalability.

## Demo

To maintain HIPAA-compliance, actual video footage from the lab is unavailable for public users of this app. By using <a href="https://vimeo.com/361224968" target="_blank">this sample video</a>, you can demo the app:

<strong>*** Please note:</strong> This app works best when used on a mobile device in landscape mode.

In the lab, actual videos (which start at the 5-minute mark and end at the 20-minute mark) will render a downloadable .xlsx file for formatted for further data analysis in the lab:
