## Welcome to the SPAFF App

This is a React web app intended for internal use within The Gottman Institute, LLC, and the <a href="https://www.gottman.com/love-lab/" target="_blank">Love Lab at The Gottman Institute</a>.

## About SPAFF

In 1989, the Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF) was developed by John Gottman, Ph.D., and Lowell J. Krokoff, Ph.D., for the purpose of systematically observing affective behavior in the context of marital conflict. The original SPAFF conferred a host of advantages over earlier “microanalytic” coding strategies, the primary innovation being the ability to code affect at the construct level instead of at the level of extremely discrete bits of behavior, such as specific gestures or facial movements (Gottman, McCoy, Coan, & Collier, 1995).

## About the App

Today, researchers in the Love Lab at The Gottman Institute continue to use the Specific Affect Coding System to analyze the affective behavior of couples during observed conflict discussions. This app is intended to digitize the process (previously conducted on equipment housed in the lab) by providing an online interface for lab analysts to rate couples conflict footage with more mobility, accuracy, and scalability.

## Demo

To maintain HIPAA-compliance, actual video footage from the lab is unavailable for public users of this app. If you do not provide a URL in the app, a sample video will load. <strong>Please note:</strong> This app works best in landscape mode on a mobile or tablet device.

The ratings selected during the duration of the video are tracked in the state object. When the video ends, the state is translated into a downloadable .xlsx file formatted for further data analysis in the lab:
