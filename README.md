## Welcome to the SPAFF App

This is an internal web app intended for use within The Gottman Institute, LLC, and the Love Lab at The Gottman Institute (https://www.gottman.com/love-lab/).

## What is SPAFF?

In 1989, the Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF) was developed by John Gottman, Ph.D., and Lowell J. Krokoff, Ph.D., for the purpose of systematically observing affective behavior in the context of marital conflict. The original SPAFF conferred a host of advantages over earlier “microanalytic” coding strategies, the primary innovation being the ability to code affect at the construct level instead of at the level of extremely discrete bits of behavior, such as specific gestures or facial movements (Gott- man, McCoy, Coan, & Collier, 1995).

Today, researchers in the Love Lab at The Gottman Institute continue to use the Specific Affect Coding System to analyze the affective behavior of couples during observed conflict discussions. This app is intended to digitize that process by providing an online interface for rating couples.
